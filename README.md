# License Plate Recognition using AI/ML

![License Plate Recognition](https://github.com/realranjan/licence-plate-recognition-using-aiml/blob/main/testset/0004_jpg.rf.eb9da83daa2257ca6954e27599941a77.jpg)

## Overview

This project implements a License Plate Recognition (LPR) system using AI/ML techniques. The system captures images of vehicles, detects the license plate, and extracts the characters from the plate using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The project is structured to help anyone interested in building a similar system from scratch using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## Features

- **License Plate Detection**: Uses image processing techniques to locate the license plate in an image.
- **Character Segmentation**: Segments the license plate into individual characters.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Recognizes and reads the characters on the license plate.
- **Model Training**: Includes the training scripts for custom character recognition models.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From image capture to license plate recognition and output.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Tesseract-OCR
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realranjan/licence-plate-recognition-using-aiml.git
cd licence-plate-recognition-using-aiml
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your training images in the `data/` directory.
2. **Training**: Run the training script to train your model on the prepared dataset.
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. **Detection and Recognition**: Use the provided script to detect and recognize license plates in new images.
   ```bash
   python recognize.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```
